1. Makhanda Circle of Unity Food Group
A diverse group of about 20 Makhanda residents has been working very hard to identify the most vulnerable, to source foods as cheaply as possible and to distribute food parcels. It is headed by Helen Alfers, backed up by Nicci Hayes and Richard Gaybba from the Makhanda Circle of Unity collective. The aim is to provide food parcels to 1000 household for at least the next 4 weeks. Each food parcel costs about R175 to feed a family per week. This will cost R700 000 for a month. They are collaborating with other initiatives listed below.

Mary Birt has single-handedly assisted around 50 families in need over the past two years. Since the lockdown began, her Food4Futures project distributions ramped up sharply with 117 parcels on 6 April, to 308 on the 20th. “Three hundred and fifty people came for food on Monday, and we simply couldn’t feed everyone.” Birt has teamed up with the Cathedral Feeding Project to receive financial support and volunteers to help buy and package food. If anyone is interested in helping out, the project needs volunteers to help package food parcels from home and more financial aid. You could email Mary Birt at mary@cottageinthegarden.co.za or Dean Andrew Hunter at ahunter@intermail.co.za to find out more.
