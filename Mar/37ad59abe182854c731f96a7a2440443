As the 21 day national lock down comes into effect today, and we retreat into our homes in an attempt to fight the novel coronavirus Kingswood College has urged the community to take up the “Reduce and Reuse 21 Day Challenge” with them. “This extended time in your homes will give you the opportunity to evaluate what you need, and that which you do not need. It will provide you with the time to do that long overdue “spring clean” or to reorganise or sort through your cupboards and take stock of what may be taking up unneeded space in your homes,” said challenge convenor Steph Bouwer. Here’s the challenge: “The needs of our community at large will be great after this lockdown is over, and together we can make a difference,” Bouwer said. “This is a project of the Kingswood Pebble Project where we hope to turn small actions into waves of change,” Bouwer said.
