Child Welfare Grahamstown received a welcome boost this week from the 2019 Grocott’s Mail Christmas Cheer Fund, which amounted to R14 300. The organisation will put the money to good use at Ikhaya Losizo Cluster Foster Home in Joza. The centre is home to around 20 vulnerable and orphaned children, and provides daytime care for around another 60. A highlight of the fundraising drive is the Pro Carmine Choir’s annual Christmas Cheer Concert at Christ Church. The audience at the annual concert has become the biggest contributor to the fund and GBS Mutual Bank. This year, the choir’s supporters contributed over R5000 to the fund. The fund is administered through GBS Mutual Bank which in 2017 donated R140 000 to Child Welfare as part of its 140th anniversary celebrations.
