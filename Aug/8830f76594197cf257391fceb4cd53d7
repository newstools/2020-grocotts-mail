During these difficult times, we invite you to share on Grocott’s Mail’s Wall of Remembrance the memory of someone close to you who has passed away. Please send a photograph of them, their name, their birth date, the date they passed away and something about them you would like to share (50-100 words). Email to community@grocotts.co.za or WhatsApp to 066 156 2956. For our reference (not for publishing) we need your full name, your relationship to the person you’re writing about, your local address and your contact details (phone number or email). You can also send a longer tribute to share on our website.
