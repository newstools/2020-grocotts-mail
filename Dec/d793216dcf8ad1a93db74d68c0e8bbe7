Gift of the Givers teams arrived on 5 December, the facility is set to officially open on 15 December. Gift of the Givers has also supplied Bhisho Hospital with 120 beds, accompanying mattresses, 240 pillows and High Flow Nasal Oxygen machines. According to the organisation, an infrastructure upgrade to provide accommodation for medical personnel is under consideration. Founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said an MOU between the Eastern Cape Department of Health and Gift of the Givers was at an advanced stage as they prepare to fund 26 paramedics to support current staff at Livingstone Hospital and the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. In addition, better quality N95 masks had been purchased and were on the way to the province to protect frontline health care workers. “High Flow Nasal Oxygen machines and consumables will be delivered soon,” said Dr Sooliman. At Settlers, the hospital’s ICU and Maternity units in the former private section are being equipped for Covid cases, rather than being restored to their former specialised functions.
