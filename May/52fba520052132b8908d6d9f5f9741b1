We share here information from the Makhanda Circle of Unity about an important survey to assess the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on local businesses. Conducted by Stats SA, it will help shape policy decisions and future planning. We encourage local businesses to complete the survey. On 21 April, StatsSA released a report entitled “Business impact survey of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa”. As might be expected, the survey results did not make for optimistic reading. We made contact with StatsSA and asked if they could conduct a survey specifically for Makana, as results are only reported at the provincial level. We are pleased to advise that they have agreed to do this. We are requesting that all businesses in Makana, no matter your size or economic activity participate. Possible questions that you might have before completing the survey and answers to these are: The link to the survey is below. The closing date is 15 May.
