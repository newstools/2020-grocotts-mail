The Eastern Cape Provincial Executive has welcomed the Supreme Court of Appeal’s ruling earlier this month granting it leave to appeal the order to dissolve Makana Municipality. Meanwhile, lawyers for the Unemployed People’s Movement have requested reasons why their Section 18 application to have Judge Stretch’s January order immediately put into effect pending the appeal application has been dismissed. Premier Oscar Mabuyane, through his spokesperson Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, said, “We welcome the SCA’s ruling. We think it helps to protect separation of powers. There are no winners and losers on this matter. We still have the responsibility to ensure that the municipality works effectively and efficiently for its people. We continue with this work.” Regarding the Section 18 application, UPM lawyer Brin Brody, of Wheeldon Rushmere and Cole confirmed it had been dismissed with costs, with no reason given. “We are asking for reasons,” Brody said.
