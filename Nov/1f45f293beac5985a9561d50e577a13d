Survey shows growing pandemic fatigue, complacency and unnecessary risk of exposure to Covid-19 during lower lockdown levels This week the Centre for Social Change, University of Johannesburg in partnership with the Development, Capable and Ethical State of the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) release the latest summary findings from the UJ/HSRC Covid-19 democracy survey. These findings illustrate, among other things, that there is a growing pandemic fatigue and greater complacency in compliance with public health measures, increasing the unnecessary risk of exposure to Covid-19 during the lower lockdown levels. These latest findings come from round 2 of the UJ/HSRC Covid-19 democracy survey, which was conducted between 3 July and 8 September, during which time South Africa’s alert levels were gradually relaxed. The data for the second round comprised of 7 966 respondents. “Findings have been weighted to match Statistics South Africa data on race, education and age, and can be regarded as broadly representative of the population at large,” the HSRC said in a media release. The survey was conducted through an online survey using the popular #datafree Moya Messenger app, which has 2 million active users. Participants are able to respond to the survey #datafree on the app as well as through the following #datafree link, which has been enabled #datafree by biNu, the parent company of Moya. According to the reasearchers, the key findings demonstrate: These and other findings combined point to ‘pandemic fatigue’, the HSRC said. “This is important to take note of, as any premature reduction in preventative behaviours poses a significant challenge in our ability to combat the virus.” Professor Abdool Karim, chair of the Covid-19 ministerial advisory group, had similarly warned about complacency, mass gatherings and eased travel restrictions as factors that are increasingly likely to make a second wave in the country inevitable.
